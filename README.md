# Gibb_ringing
Working on Gibbs Ringing removal.
This algorithm, is an adaption of the algorithm suggested by:

Kellner et al. Gibbs‐ringing artifact removal based on local subvoxel‐shifts (2016). Magn Reson Med 76:1574–1581

The full adapted version of algorithm is described in chapter 3 of this thesis:

Neto Henriques, R. (2018). Advanced Methods for Diffusion MRI Data Analysis and their Application to the Healthy Ageing Brain (Doctoral thesis). https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.29356

I also followed his work.
